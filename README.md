# My top 3 favorite champions in league of legends
# No 1 - AKALI
![AKALI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102655245/160816170-1a2d6631-3864-4d5b-ac7b-d1aea7f4d370.jpg)

Abandoning the Kinkou Order and her title of the Fist of Shadow, Akali Akali now strikes alone, ready to be the deadly weapon her people need. Though she holds onto all she learned from her master Shen, she has pledged to defend Ionia from its enemies, one kill at a time. Akali may strike in silence, but her message will be heard loud and clear: fear the assassin with no master. 
# ABILITIES:

**PASSIVE - ASSASSIN'S MARK**
Dealing spell damage to a champion creates a ring of energy around them. Exiting that ring empowers Akali's next autoattack with bonus range and damage.

**Q - FIVE POINT STRIKE**
Akali throws out five kunai, dealing damage based on her bonus Attack Damage and Ability Power and slowing.

**W - TWILIGHT SHROUD**
Akali drops a cover of smoke and briefly gains Move Speed. While inside the shroud, Akali becomes invisible and unable to be selected by enemy spells and attacks. Attacking or using abilities will briefly reveal her.

**E - SHURIKEN FLIP**
Flip backward and fire a shuriken forward, dealing magic damage. The first enemy or smoke cloud hit is marked. Re-cast to dash to the marked target, dealing additional damage

**R - PERFECT EXECUTION**
Akali leaps in a direction, damaging enemies she strikes. Re-cast: Akali dashes in a direction, executing all enemies she strikes.

# NO 2 - SERAPHINE 

![SERAPHINE](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102655245/160816416-f1d47cde-5afc-4348-9771-781f4fe82442.jpg)

Turn the sounds of souls around you into music with Seraphine, the Starry-Eyed Songstress. Learn more about her magical auditory synesthesia and musical abilities.
"ONE DAY, THE MUSIC WILL STOP. BETTER DANCE WHILE YOU CAN!"

# ABILITIES:

**Passive - STAGE PRESENCE**

Every third basic ability Seraphine casts will echo, automatically casting a second time. Additionally, whenever she casts an ability nearby an ally, she will create a Note. Each Note gives her basic attacks more attack range and deal additional magic damage, consuming the Note.

**Q - HIGH NNOTE**
Seraphine projects a pure note, dealing magic damage that's increased by the target's missing health percentage.

**W - SURROUND SOUND**
Seraphine surrounds her nearby allies in a song, granting herself and her allies movement speed and a shield. If Seraphine is already shielded, she can heal her nearby allies, restoring health based on how many allies are near her.

**E - BEAT DROP**
Seraphine unleashes a heavy soundwave, dealing magic damage to enemies in a line and slowing them. Enemies that are already slowed are rooted, and already rooted enemies are stunned.

**R - ENCORE**
Seraphine takes the stage, projecting a captivating force that charms enemies and deals magic damage. Any champions struck (allies included) become part of the performance, extending the range of the ability and granting allies maximum Notes.

# NO 3 - KAI'SA

![KAISA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102655245/160821044-b83a74ab-7fe4-4617-a24b-ce55ab8dc995.jpg)

Claimed by the Void when she was only a child, Kai'Sa managed to survive through sheer tenacity and strength of will. Her experiences have made her a deadly hunter and, to some, the harbinger of a future they would rather not live to see. Having entered into an uneasy symbiosis with a living Void carapace, the time will soon come when she must decide whether to forgive those mortals who would call her a monster, and defeat the coming darkness togetherâ€¦ or simply to forget, as the Void consumes the world that left her behind.

# ABILITIES:

**PASSIVE - SECOND SKIN**
Kai'Sa's basic attacks stack Plasma, dealing increasing bonus magic damage. Allies' immobilizing effects help stack Plasma. Additionally, Kai'Sa's item purchases upgrade her basic spells to have more powerful properties.

**Q - ICATHIAN RAIN**
Kai'Sa shoots a swarm of missiles that seek out nearby targets. Living Weapon: Icathian Rain is upgraded to shoot more missiles

**W - VOID SEEKER**
Kai'Sa shoots a long range missile, marking enemies with her passive. Living Weapon: Void Seeker is upgraded to apply more passive marks and reduce cooldown on champion hit.

**E - SUPERCHARGE**
Kai'Sa briefly increases her Move Speed, then increases her Attack Speed. Living Weapon: Supercharge is upgraded to briefly grant Invisibility

**R - KILLER INSTINCT**
Kai'Sa dashes near an enemy champion.
